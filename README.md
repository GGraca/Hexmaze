Game:

Your objective as a red dot player is to get to the oposite house and come back to yours

Controls are WASD + Space and Arrows + End

Dev info:

This game was mad with low knowledge of game theory and thus it's consuming all the cpu

I really enjoyed the game mechanics idea. If anyone is interested in continuing the project and needs help pay me a beer and i'm glad to help
